### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Rob Nichols - I have been a full stack software developer since 2014. I have worked with many languages and technologies, I enjoy .NET C#, Angular and relational databases. Some of the other languages I've worked with include vanilla JavaScript, TypeScript, Python and NoSQL databases like MongoDB. I have worked with RabbitMQ and Kafka messaging queues and most frequently in the microservices patterns. Though I have had some exposure to TDD and Service Oriented Architecture. I enjoy learning and improving my understanding of these technologies. I am also happy to share what I know with others.

- ðŸŒ± I enjoy learning! Whether it is within the .NET environment or new areas, I enjoy finding solutions that work best to resolve challenges.
